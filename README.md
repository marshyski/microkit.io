# Golang Microservices

This lean book will be a guide and list of resources to build small services in [Golang](https://golang.org/).  I'm catering to developers building services for enterprises that want to adopt Golang.  Skimming the chapters you should get a better idea of which toolkits and frameworks better suit you.
