# Deploying Golang Microservices

This lean git-book will be a guide and list of resources to develop and deploy microservices in [Golang](https://golang.org/).  I'm catering to developers building services for enterprises that want to adopt Golang.  Skimming the chapters you should get a better idea of toolkits and deployment practices that better suit you.

The goal of this git-book is to be a resource kit for people buildings kits in other languages, articles and books.
